## Synopsis

Creating a Software Ecosphere: MyBooks Tutorial - See http://blueottersoftware.com/2017/06/19/mybooks-tutorial-index/ for the actual tutorial
We'll be using GCP and creating the database, restful webservices, web application, and an iOS app to manage/create a home library catalog.   I'm tired of buying multiple copies of books I thought I'd lost ;)

## Code Example


## Motivation

I wanted to create a tutorial and I also want to manage my home libraries, additionally I'm using this project as the start to an investigation as to the performance of various restful API stacks.

## Installation

See the tutorial for more information.   There's sql, ruby, html, and swift in here (or will be)

## API Reference


## Tests


## Contributors

At this time the code has been created and maintained by Randy Carver and as the head geek and (only) bottle washer, what he says goes.   Except for Bob.   He has root.
